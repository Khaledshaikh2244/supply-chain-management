## Overview

The Supply Chain Management on Ethereum project tracks the provenance and authenticity of products from origin to consumer. By using smart contracts, the system ensures that all transactions and changes in the supply chain are recorded immutably on the blockchain, providing a transparent and trustworthy record for all stakeholders.

## Features

- **Transparency**: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring a transparent supply chain process.
- **Traceability**: Track the journey of products from their origin to the end consumer.
- **Security**: Immutable records on the blockchain prevent tampering and fraud.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Stakeholders can easily monitor and manage supply chain activities through a simple interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Development and Testing**: Hardhat
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Ethers.js
- **Front-end**: React.js
